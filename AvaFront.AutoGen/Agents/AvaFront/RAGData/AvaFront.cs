Users interfacing with technology has come a long way. With computers we began with the Command Line Interfaces (CLI): 
Early user interfaces were predominantly text-based, requiring users to input commands through a command line. 
This type of interface was not very intuitive and required specific knowledge of command syntax.
Next, the Graphical User Interfaces (GUI): This was a huge leap forward for being user-friendly.
Users could interact with software through visual elements like buttons and icons, making operations more intuitive.
With the advent of the internet, web-based interfaces became prominent. 
Everyone needed a dotcom and website to legitimize their business. A time is coming when everyone will need an AI agent.
Enter AvaFront, the next generation in customer experience. Imagine having a 24/7 avatar that can greet customers, 
answer inquiries, manage appointments, resolve complaints, and even assist with sales support all through natural 
conversations.
